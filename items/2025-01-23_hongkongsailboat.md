  Sailboat in Hong Kong Victoria Harbour (帆船x維港)

  What is your first impression of old Hong Kong?
  Maybe the sailboats and ferries in Victoria Harbour.
  Shipping was one of the main economic source and transportation of HK in the past.
  Taikoo and Whampoa were well-known dock companies but they shifted their business to real estate nowadays.
  In spite of declining importance of shipping, the ships still leaves in our heads.
