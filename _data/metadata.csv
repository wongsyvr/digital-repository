The artwork captures the historical significance of this iconic colonial building.

第二代香港會大樓建於1897年，由於當時會所需要更大空間，1895年政府以極少有的999年租約，把昃臣道1號的地皮，租予香港會作為興建新會所之用。租約限制極小，同類型的租約例如有現時的美國領事館。
1979年，香港會的管理委員會指基於建築物老化而產生潛在危險，同時維修費高昂，最終會員只好接受將建築物拆卸重建。
現在的香港會所大廈是第三代，是1981年6月拆除第二代會所大廈後於原地重建。

後記
其實依幅剪紙整咗已經一年，之前都post過一次。
記得整依張剪紙嗰陣用咗好多時間勾線執相。
前前後後差唔多一個月先整好。
仲要中途整爛咗一張🥲",Art & Design Series,ART-PC-2025-01-15,Image;StillImage,eng; cn,Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.
